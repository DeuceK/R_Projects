tp1: []
tp2: [F 10]
tp1 now as tp2+tp3: [F 10 R 90]
tp1 now as tp2 * 3: [F 10 F 10 F 10]
tp4 is a copy of tp1: [F 10 F 10 F 10]
tp5: [F 10]
tp2 and tp5 are == to each other: true
tp2 and tp3 are != to each other: true
index 0 of tp2 is F
tp2 after 2 calls to setIndex: [R 90]
tp2 and tp3 are == to each other: true
tpAdd += tpAdd2: [F 20 R 45]
tpMultiply *= 5: [F 10 F 10 F 10 F 10 F 10]
Done.
